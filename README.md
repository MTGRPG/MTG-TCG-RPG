# Brief Synopsis of Magic RPG


### Character Creation
Characters are created via a points system as explained on the character creation sheet. Currently only really works for completely new (i.e. inexperienced) characters, but it should do for now.

As with all topics, feedback is appreciated

### Gameplay
In traditional RPG fashion, the idea of the skill/attribute check is central to the Magic RPG.

Character attributes are not rolled for or placed on the character sheet, but are instead represented by the contents of the character deck.

There are three attribute categories: physical, mental, and social. Each color has a corresponding attribute in each category. When a check is mandated, the player reveals cards until 3 non-land cards are face up. The number of colored mana symbols associated with the attribute are counted and compared to the difficulty of the check. Meeting or exceeding the check value means success.

Opposing checks are done between decks, where the deck which reveals the highest mana count wins.

**Note: the current system allows for players to only pass checks which include their colors, meaning a red mage will never be able to pass an intelligence check, for example. We want to implement a deck that any player can conduct a check from with a low chance of success.**

### Changes to normal magic play
Basic magic rules are mostly intact, but there are a few differences. For example, players gain abilities via race/experience which allow the player to be more directly interactive with the board state. Player’s characters obtain abilities which allow them to buff creatures, hand size, etc

Coupled with that, characters can also have up to 3 pieces of equipment (artifacts; number subject to balancing) equipped. The equipment must be justifiable on the part of the player (this GM expects an excellent explanation for why it’s okay to have both swiftfoot boots and fleetfeather sandals). This equipment starts in the command zone and may be put into play by casting as if it were in your hand. If the equipment finishes the game in the graveyard it is considered lost.

Another change is that one player’s creatures can block for another player, allowing more robust creatures to tank for more fragile players.

Last, healing spells which normally may only be used on yourself may be used on another player for an additional cost of one colorless. Hence, players may heal other characters more easily.

### Combat-random encounters and boss fights!

This is where the actual magic games come in. The GM creates random encounter decks (lots of forest baddies, evil merfolk, whatever), dungeon decks (lots of “traps” with fireball cards, plenty of skeletons, etc), and boss decks for players to fight against.

Normally 5 decks v 1 deck sounds pretty unfair, but conveniently Wizards has already addressed that issue with the Archenemy format. The singleton deck gets supercool effects via scheme cards that level the playing field. While that may be a little overkill for piddly random encounters (maybe just let the enemy draw an extra card or something every turn), it seems very appropriate for bosses to have all kinds of evil schemes to antagonize the heroes.

### Character development

Players may earn experience through good gameplay and excellent fluff. Said experience may be spent on additional cards, improved player characteristics, or character class selection.

Honestly, the class system is probably the thing that requires the most attention. I paired D&D classes with the different color combinations (there are fifteen 1-and-2 color combinations and 16 classes on the wiki) in order to get an idea of what kind of class might be associated with that color: straight white makes an excellent cleric, blue is very wizardly, green/red is much like a shaman, and so forth. The 3-color combinations are tricker; some are easy like white/blue/black which has excellent artifacts and artificer seemed a good title. Others require titles still.

Additionally, no bonuses have currently been selected for these classes, although JP has started on some character abilities. If anybody has ideas in that regard, by all means fill out some spreadsheet cells. Anyways, those are the big things I’ve got so far. Give me some feedback and I’ll start making adjustments!
