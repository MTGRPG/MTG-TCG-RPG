# Character creation rules:

### 1. The player chooses their character’s color identity as determined by the class or classes they have chosen for said character.

The class rules function as follows:
- A player may add any one color to their color identity by purchasing a monocolor class. ex: a new character with no color identity may choose to be red by purchasing the warrior (monored) class
- A character may not choose a multicolor class without having all of the requisite colors already in their identity ex: the monored character from before wants to be a sorcerer (UR) class. The character must therefore purchase the wizard (monoblue) class, which makes their identity UR. They may then purchase the sorcerer class.
- The principle is the same for 3-color classes. If the UR sorcerer wants to add black to become a battlemage, the warlock class (monoblack) must be purchased and then the separate cost may be paid to unlock the battlemage (UBR) class

### 2. Choose a race found in the exact color combination you’ve chosen.

Keep in mind that this may limit which planes and color combinations can initially go together. A BR character may be a vampire from Innistrad, and may eventually add W to their color identity. However, a character beginning with a WBR color identity could only originate from Tarkir.

### 3. Players choose a plane which is home to the race and color combination previously generated.

Some characters may fit multiple planes (a RW character could be from Ravnica or Lorwyn for example) while others may only fit one plane (shard-colored characters will be from Alara)
- Kamigawa
- Lorwyn
- Zendikar
- Innistrad
- Theros
- Ravnica
- Mirrodin
- Alara
- Tarkir

The player will have access to spells from that plane. Note that certain planes contain multiple blocks-worth of cards (mirrodin and scars of mirrodin are both unsurprisingly from mirrodin).


### 4. The character uses remaining starting points to purchase spells and land that will be part of their initial 60-card deck

Spells and land may only be purchased for colors in the character’s color identity. Additionally, multicolor (gold or hybrid-cost cards) may only be used if the character has the appropriate mixed-color class. A player’s first mixed-color class cost is waived.

Ex: the monored character from above could purchase lightning bolt as well as goblin king for use. Once the player has paid for the wizard class, their color identity is UR. They may now purchase spells such as ponder or counterspell. Notice that the character is a fighter-wizard and CANNOT purchase a spell like goblin electromancer because a multicolor card would require the character to be a sorcerer. In short, unlocking access 2-color spells requires 3 purchases: color A class, color B class, color AB class. The color AB class cost is waived during character creation, although adding additional classes during a campaign still costs points.

A player cannot purchase more of a higher rarity of cards belonging to a class than they have lower rarity cards

Ex: The player purchases 32 common spells, an uncommon spell, and a rare spell. The player may not purchase another rare spell, as that would mean he has 2 rare spells purchased and only 1 uncommon.


### 5 Make sure that all of the stuff you’ve decided is filled out on your character sheet.

For extra flavor and backstory, you can fill in some defining moments in the life of your character that have shaped him/her into who they are at the time of the campaign. Remember DMs love it when you players put extra work into things, and there could be extra experience points for those that go the extra mile.

I think the above rules allows for multiple ideas I wanted to implement
1. Monocolored classes have some incentive, since players will spend fewer points to unlock their class, which means more points to spend on actual spells. I wanted there to be incentives to keeping things simple.
2. It’s still perfectly possible to build a multicolor deck. I also wanted to capture the flavor difference between being a hybrid class and fully committing to both colors, or instead simply dipping into another color for a little added utility
3. It’s possible to modify one’s color identity as the campaign progresses, allowing people flexibility to modify their deck and playstyle.
4. Players can’t invest heavily in higher rarity (and presumably better) cards without first making an investment in worse cards. I want to promote optimal play with sub-optimal cards

I’ve tried to make a fairly straightforward pricing guide to everything that makes it pretty easy to create a character. My biggest concern currently is whether monocolored classes actually have too much of an advantage of multicolor to start out. Let me know what you think/what we could do to mitigate the discrepancy.


Here’s a quick example of a points scheme I was thinking of

- 1 pt-basic land
- 2 pts-common
- 4 pts-uncommon
- 8 pts-rare
- 10 pts-mythic
- 15 pts-class unlock

So a basic 2-color character would look something like this:

- UG alchemist
- U class – 15 pts
- G class – 15 pts
- UG class – free for character creation

- 22 basic land – 22 pts
- 2 common non-basic land (like guildgates) – 4 pts
- 29 commons-58 pts
- 5 uncommon – 20 pts
- 2 rare- 16 pts

- Total 150 pts, 61 cards
Meanwhile, a monocolored would look more like this

- W cleric
- W class- 15 pts

- 23 basic land – 23 pts

- 28 common – 56 pts
- 6 uncommon – 24 pts
- 4 rare – 32 pts

- Total 150 pts, 61 cards
